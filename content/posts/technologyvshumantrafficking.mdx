Despite the abolishment of slavery across multiple continents in the 1800s, a 2017 report states that “An estimated 40.3 million people were victims of modern slavery in 2016.” As of 2018, only 47,299 victims of human trafficking have been successfully detected - a woeful 0.001% of suspected victims.



Human trafficking is internationally and legally defined as the result of three things: “(i) action (recruitment, transport, selling, ...); (ii) means (threat, bribery, ...); and (iii) purpose (exploitation).”



Prepared testimony for a Congressional hearing on The Role of Technology in Countering Trafficking in Persons states that those involved in human trafficking “have \[benefited from] technological advances. In the last decade, the advertising of sex trafficking victims has moved from the streets to the internet, providing greater efficiency and anonymity for traffickers and complicating the ability of law enforcement to disrupt these illicit organizations.” Such unfortunate benefits include access to a greater number of potential victims in the form of social media and online chat rooms, ease of secure communication between traffickers due to VPNs and high-level encryption, as well as the development of online communities for traffickers of children - all of which make it easier for traffickers to operate, and harder for law enforcement to catch them.



Enter: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory.



MIT Lincoln Laboratory, according to their website, “develops a broad array of advanced technologies to meet critical security needs” and they have turned their talents to designing technology to combat human trafficking. Lin Li, an employee of MIT Lincoln Laboratory and researcher in the Artificial Intelligence Group, and her team have been designing and developing machine learning algorithms. These algorithms aim to analyse commercial sex ads located online to rank the likelihood of human traffickers being the origin of such ads and if they originate from the same source. Natural language processing is used to create templates of the ads by isolating unique phrases before searching for matches to the template across multiple websites. Through this process, Li says it could well lead to “discovering an organization’s entire operation” which allows them to disrupt it as a whole, rather than in pieces that could be rebuilt.



The importance of technological developments in combating human trafficking is emphasised by the stories of survivors. A 2020 UNICEF article quotes a 17-year-old female victim of human trafficking. “\[The traffickers] said we would be treated well, but it was a lie. A lot of the girls were raped.” The traffickers of these young girls were part of a network that organised the transport of their victims from Nigeria to Europe with the promise of jobs and care, and there are numerous survivors with similar stories: the offer of a job followed by a betrayal of trust and exploitation.



Human trafficking is a global crime strengthened by technology, but further advancements in technology by those such as MIT Lincoln Laboratories can turn the tide. In doing so, they’ll help to reduce the number of people, young and old, male and female, that are victimised by human trafficking.
