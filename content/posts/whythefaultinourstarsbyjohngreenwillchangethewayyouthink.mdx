Why ‘The Fault in Our Stars’ by John Green will change the way you think

Luisa Monteiro

☆☆☆☆☆

From my experience, cancer isn’t a topic most readers chose to pick up regularly, but John Green found his own, spectacular, way to bring great awareness to it. The importance of understanding what these children (and adults) go through is something that not many authors can portray. So this is why I gave ‘The Fault in Our Stars’ by John Green five stars.

This book opened my eyes. The book was a walk through the protagonist's (Hazel Grace Lancaster) mind, and reading her thoughts really made me realise how she truly felt. Like each of us, she was still a kid, and she didn’t want people’s pity, she didn’t want to be seen differently. That didn’t mean that she was ashamed of who she was. Hazel describes that “the thing about pain, \[is that] it demands to be felt.”  This made me think of cancer as a journey,  an honourable, tragic  journey. This is shown when Augustus reflects, “You’d see Jesus on the cross, and you’d see a dude getting stabbed in the neck, and you’d see people dying at sea and in battle and a parade of martyrs. But Not. One. Single. Cancer. Kid. Nobody biting it from the plague or smallpox or yellow fever or whatever, because there is no glory in illness. There is no meaning to it. There is no honour in dying of cancer.”  

Aside from the brilliant story aspects, John Green’s writing is influential. His writing is explanatory but still perfectly clear to readers who are new to this topic. His characters are three dimensional, and you feel as if you’ve gotten to know them as you get further into the story. Hazel once said; “the only thing worse than biting it from cancer is having a kid bite it from cancer.” Throughout the whole book, Hazel’s mum, despite having a small part in the book, feels like a fully developed and important character. Having her in the book gives us more of an insight on their family status and how her mom was impacted by Hazel’s condition. 

Throughout my whole reading experience, I felt greatly impacted as a reader, but also as part of the audience that belongs to John Green. It was educational and really influenced me, and I cannot begin to imagine the way it might influence a child with a similar condition to the ones mentioned in this book. Such powerful writing really is refreshing, but along with that is a powerful story, with a powerful message that I guarantee will stick with you.

Cancer was never a topic I spent much time thinking about because in my life, I have never accompanied or experienced anything to do with it. Which is part of the reason this book really changed me, and gave me more of an insight on what it’s like. It was dedicated to Esther Earl, a girl who experienced the same thing as Hazel. The Fault in our Stars isn’t only a story about cancer, it’s a story about people, and how certain conditions can affect those in their lives. And it is a story about love, and how it impacts everyone differently.
