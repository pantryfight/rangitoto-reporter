On Tuesday 13th September the Rangitoto school community enjoyed the Pipiwharauroa Festival. This festival celebrated the tikanga of the Maori and Pasifika community in Rangitoto and the other schools in the Mid Bays Kahui Ako. Events on the day included cultural performances and food and activity stalls organised by the Year 10 Business Studies students.

Many students, not just from Rangitoto College, but from many other schools such as Northcross Intermediate, Murrays Bay Intermediate, and Mairangi Bay Primary School, performed cultural performances. These cultural performances were spectacular, showcasing the work of different Kapa Haka groups from across the North Shore. The students performed waiata and haka that inspired the Rangitoto Students. We loved how the day incorporated multiple schools from around the North Shore area. It was fantastic to see all the primary, and intermediate school’s performances.  It was fantastic to see the amount of effort that had been put into these performances by the students, and to see the end result, which was amazing.

There were a wide range of stalls by the Year 10 Business Studies students. These stalls included bubble tea, bake stalls, candy and activities such as mini basketball. The stalls all sold different items that Year 10s put effort into and there was an outstanding result with many people purchasing from the stalls. We personally really enjoyed the baking as the food presentation was excellent and there was a wide variety to choose from. In general it was a very great experience and allowed the community to get together and celebrate togetherness and Maori culture.
