Quotes:

Care about what you think yourself, not what others think of you

If you don’t have confidence, you’ll drown in your sorrow

You need to stop overthinking because the world doesn’t revolve around you, and even if you think everyone’s thinking about how you’ve done, they’re probably not, because you’re not the only person in the world.

Mental health is more important than school work, friends and anything else.

Be nice.
