Mr Easthope: The Rise to Rangi



Rangitoto College is a well known school popular for its massive premises, unique learning set up and their united community. However, one of the most important parts of the Rangitoto College unit are the teachers involved; as without them, the school would have an even more increased boredom rate. These teachers range from a variety of personalities, each with their own skill set.

One of the most likeable is a semi world famous JSS teacher, Mr Easthope. When younger, Mr Easthope’s parents unfortunately went through a divorce and this led to a fairly sensitive environment with his mum. When growing up, Mr Easthope looked up to many people such as Lebron James and most importantly, his older brother as he compared his failures and successes to him and took that as a sign on what he should and is capable of achieving in the future. This increased his inspiration as he was inspired to see others achieving.

Mr Eathope set his mind to basketball which he excelled at, becoming a part of the under 20s team, which he stated he was very fortunate to get into as he personally didn’t like the sport and only played it because he was a reasonable height and good at the game. As a result of becoming a member of this team, he learnt a lot and met a lot of new people such as professional NZ Basketballer, Jack Salt. When pursuing this aspect of his life, Mr Easthope also had various hairstyles, his preferred style being his 2018 one which involved shaved hair on the sides and the rest of his hair and beard plaited. 

Going back to his more recent career, you may be wondering how Mr Easthope stepped on to the teaching platform he has today. One of the reasons why he started at Rangi was because he had a not so nice time at the previous school he was working for which will not be named. When asked what he wished he knew five years ago, Mr Easthope said that he would want to know he would want to pursue teaching and he would start his teaching career earlier on as it would have “saved him a lot of time.”

He also gained many values such as honesty. He lives by the mantra “if you're not honest, you're done” and respect for yourself and others which are great values to have in your daily life. Some hobbies and interests Eathope has in his personal life include cooking (he makes sure to cook something new every month),  playing with his bulldog Rexy, playing Warzone on his playstation and having interests in both marvel and comics in general. In the future, Mr Easthope would like to continue his teaching career, become a world champion and go to the olympics. Easthope would also like to improve on areas of productivity and spending time with a more wise and conscious approach in the future.
