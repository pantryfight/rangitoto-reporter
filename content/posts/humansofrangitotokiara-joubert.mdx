Mia Coetzee had an interesting life moving to New Zealand and then being able to sign with Unique Modelling Management . She had won Miss Teen South Africa in early 2019 and prepared to move here in December. They have sold everything, but COVID struck, leaving them essentially homeless, so they started travelling around Africa for the time being. This was so they could wait for the pandemic to calm down a bit. Because that did not happen, she missed 6 months of school, but after she started homeschooling she caught up. 



Her passion to do modelling mostly revolves around her mother telling her to do so along with a lot of people who wanted her to do that as well. So she went for it, and signed up with Unique Modelling Management . Her most important values are respect—she feels if she gives you respect you should be able to return it, which most people don't understand. One of her biggest struggles is being anxious, but she is working and improving by holding her most important values close. One of these includes positivity, which means she sees the glass half full  on a daily basis .



Her role model is mainly her dad. His hard work, time and effort inspires her. Her celebrity role model is Emily Nel Peters. The reason she looks up to her is because she won Miss South Africa in 2007. She is also Miss Universe. The way she grew up and successful  rise makes up a big part of her as a person. Something she wishes she knew five years ago is just  to go for it, not to hold back, do what you love and not let anything hold you back. You will achieve a lot if you put the effort in.
