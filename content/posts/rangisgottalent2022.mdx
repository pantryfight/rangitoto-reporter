On the 4th August at lunchtime the annual Rangi’s Got Talent competition was held. It was an amazing showcase of talent at Rangitoto College.

To start this event off, members of the Korean Committee performed a traditional Korean instrumental using multiple drums. The performers came up with creative ideas as to how they could create music without the use of lyrics or other instruments. The music was fast-paced, exciting and enjoyable. The second act was the solo singer Patricia.The song that she sang was an original song called “One and Only.” This song was a romantic song; her lyrics talked about her past relationship. Many people loved her performance; in the middle of the performance people even started waving flashlights, showing how much they loved her song. 

The third act was a contemporary dance by the dancer Melody Ulrich. This performance, like the others, was popular with the audience, and was very impressive due to the sheer amount of skill that was shown. The dance fit very well with the song playing in the background, which made for an excellent performance. The fourth act was a soloist rapping an original rap; a lot of people loved this act too. His rapping was fast paced, and exciting. The beat of the music, and the atmosphere of his performance matched his song. 

The final act was the popular band, The Birds. This band consisted of two bassists, a keyboard player, a guitarist and a drummer. The song that they played was an original composition called “I’m Running,” which briefly covered a situation similar to a break up. The students really enjoyed the event and many rated it 10/10 saying that “it was fun.”
